Compatible with home-assistant >= 0.80

The master instance connects to the Websocket APIs of the slaves, the connection options are specified via the `host`, `port`, and `secure` configuration parameters. An API password can also be set via `api_password`.

After the connection is completed, the remote states get populated into the master instance.
The entity ids can optionally be prefixed via the `entity_prefix` parameter.

The component keeps track which objects originate from which instance. Whenever a service is called on an object, the call gets forwarded to the particular slave instance.

When the connection to the remote instance is lost, all previously published states are removed again from the local state registry.

A possible use case for this is to be able to use different Z-Wave networks, on different Z-Wave sticks (with the second one possible running on another computer in a different location).

## Installation 

To use this plugin, copy the `remote_homeassistant.py` file into your [custom_components folder](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/creating_component_loading.html).
